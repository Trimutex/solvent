# solvent

A method of breaking down all of your tasks into a single framework.


# why?

There are often many tasks to attend to in your life, and organizing them 
can be annoying. As such, I've decided to share my method of task management.
This method is a step above my previous method of

Begin by simply creating your own private repository! The key to this method
is using the `projects` feature. You can organize current tasks by using
this feature.

There are three main categories to this idea:

## category 1: the single issue

This one is fairly straight forward. An issue arises in something you are 
doing, so you add a single issue to the issues tab and plan using a general project.

## category 2: the multi-part issue

Do you have multiple steps to take for this? Then keep track of it all together
by using a single issue that keeps track of the sub-problems with markdown
checkboxes.


# rest of the repository

There's basically nothing in this repository though, what can I do with it?
The short answer here is: whatever you want! Expand on the idea as much or as
little as you need. Feel free to create PRs on this original repository to
help others with ideas too!

## example
If you begin to find that you want to keep track of some specific files as
part of an ongoing task, then do this:

1. create a branch in the repo
2. add those files in a commit
    - this could be as simple as a `documents` directory and adding it there
    - personal note: I recommend keeping the root directory clean here
3. create a merge request into your own main branch
4. mention the issue with `closes #[commit number]`
5. merge the branch and now you have a link to where the file came from
